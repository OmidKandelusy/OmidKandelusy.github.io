    <h1> Thanks for dropping by! </h1>
    <h2> Bio: </h2>
    <p> I am an Electrical Engineering PhD graduate; 
        my education were mostly focused on theoretical analysis of
        the physical layer in wireless communication systems, and 
        communication protocols. I have experience in designing 
        communication protocols via embedded C programing and 
        real time operating systems (RTOS)s for 2.4 GHz as well as
        sub GHz ISM bands.
        I am comfortable with different scripting and computation tools
        such as Python and Matlab and object oriented coding style.
        I was a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the 
        University of Kansas and I have research experience
        in dynamic spectrum access, signal processing, coding theory,
        and federated machine learning.  </p>

        <p> I am from Iran where I received my BSc and MSc in electrical
            engineering. I came to US to pursue my PhD reseasrch journey 
            in 2017 and I graduated from University of New Hampshire in 2021. 
            I am currently a wireless communication engineer at Passivelogic 
            where we develop wireless sensor network for our AI-driven digital 
            twin which will transform the efficiency of the future buildings 
            and cities. </p>
